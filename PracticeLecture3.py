# Let‘s Practice
# WAP to ask the user to enter names of their 3 favorite movies & store them in a list.
# cine = []
# cine0 = input("Enter the name of 1st favorite movie : ")
# cine1 = input("Enter the name of 2nd favorite movie : ")
# cine2 = input("Enter the name of 3rd favorite movie : ")
# cine.append(cine0)
# cine.append(cine1)
# cine.append(cine2)
# print(cine)


# WAP to check if a list contains a palindrome of elements. (Hint: use copy( ) method)
# a = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
# b = [1, "abc", "abc", 1]
# c = a.copy()
# c.reverse()
# if a == c:
#     print("It's a palindrome")
# else:
#     print("Not a palindrome")

# Let‘s Practice
# WAP to count the number of students with the “A” grade in the following tuple.
# Grades = ("C", "D" "A", "A", "B", "B", "A")
# print(Grades.count("A"))

# Store the above values in a list & sort them from “A” to “D”.
# Grades = ["C", "D", "A", "A", "B", "B", "A"]
# Grades.sort()
# print(Grades)
