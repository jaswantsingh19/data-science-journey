# Let‘s Practice
# Store following word meanings in a python dictionary :
# table : “a piece of furniture”, “list of facts & figures”
# cat : “a small animal”

# gyan = {
#     "table": ["a piece of furniture", "list of facts & figures"],
#     "cat": "a small animal",

# You are given a list of subjects for students.
# Assume one classroom is required for 1 subject.
# How many classrooms are needed by all students.
# ”python”, “java”, “C++”, “python”, “javascript”,
# “java”, “python”, “java”, “C++”, “C”

# sub = {
#     "python",
#     "java",

#     "python",
#     "java",
#     "C++",

# print(len(sub))


# Let‘s Practice
# WAP to enter marks of 3 subjects from the user and store them in a dictionary.
# Start with an empty dictionary & add one by one.
# Use subject name as key & marks as value.

# marks = {}
# eng = float(input("Enter Marks of Eng: "))
# math = float(input("Enter Marks of Math: "))
# sci = float(input("Enter Marks of Sci: "))
# marks.update({"eng": eng})
# marks.update({"math": math})
# marks.update({"sci": sci})
# print(marks)


# Figure out a way to store 9 & 9.0 as separate values in the set.
# (You can take help of built-in data types)

# set = {("a", 9), ("b", 9.0)}
# print(set)
