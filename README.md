# data-science-journey
35 years old, bpo customer care representative, starting a journey to switch career paths from non-technical/non-IT to coding and A.I. based career. 
With a 4‑year plan you can become hireable in 12–18 months as a Data Analyst while completing a full Bachelor’s in Data Science/AI over four years; start with Python, statistics, SQL and projects, then progress to ML, deployment, and research foundations — choose an accredited online or campus bachelor from IIT Madras, IIT Guwahati, BITS Pilani, University of London, ASU, or IGNOU depending on cost, flexibility, and recognition.

Roadmap overview and role ladder
	• Year 0 goal: move into entry roles — Data Analyst → Data Scientist / ML Engineer → Research Scientist as long‑term options.
	• Core skills to master: Python, SQL, statistics, data cleaning, visualization, machine learning basics, Git, cloud basics, and one deployment tool. These are the building blocks employers expect EMFSS Online.

4‑year study + career plan (30 hrs/week)
Years 1–1.5 Hireable skills fast track
	• Months 1–3: Excel, Python basics, SQL, basic statistics; build an exploratory analysis and dashboard.
	• Months 4–9: Pandas, data cleaning, visualization, intermediate SQL, scikit‑learn regression/classification; publish 2 projects on GitHub.
	• Months 10–18: Advanced ML topics (feature engineering, model evaluation), basic deep learning or NLP, Kaggle micro‑competitions; apply for junior analyst/data engineer roles while starting degree coursework. This skills‑first route is the fastest path to paid roles Collegedunia.
Years 2–4 Bachelor’s plus specialization
	• Years 2–3: Complete core undergraduate modules (math, probability, algorithms, databases, ML). Do internships and campus immersions.
	• Year 4: Capstone, advanced electives (NLP, CV, MLOps), research project if aiming for research scientist track. Choose a program with capstone + internship support for best outcomes bitspilani-digital.edu.in Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati.

Risks, trade‑offs, and practical tips
	• Time vs income: full bachelor + career switch is intensive; expect 18–36 months to stable mid‑level roles. Mitigate by taking entry analyst jobs early and doing degree part‑time.
	• Recognition: verify UGC/DEB or regional accreditation before enrolling; check internship and placement support Collegedunia.
	• Project focus: employers value projects and internships over certificates — build 4–6 polished projects and a capstone.
