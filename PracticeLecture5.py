# Let‘s Practice
# Print numbers from 1 to 100.
# a = 1
# while a <= 100:
#     print(a)
#     a += 1

# Print numbers from 100 to 1.
# a = 100
# while a >= 1:
#     print(a)
#     a -= 1


# Print the multiplication table of a number n.
# n = int(input("Table Number : "))
# a = 1
# while a <= 10:
#     print(a * n)
#     a += 1

# Print the elements of the following list using a loop:
# a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
# n = 0
# while n <= len(a) - 1:
#     print(a[n])
#     n += 1


# Search for a number x in this tuple using loop:
