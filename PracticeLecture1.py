# Let's Practice
# Write a Program to input 2 numbers & use all posible
# arithmetic, relational, assignment, logical operators,
# and type casting (implicit & explicit) on them.


# # # Arithmetic Operations
# # a = int(input("Enter first number (a): "))
# # b = int(input("Enter second number (b): "))
# # print("Addition:", a + b)  # Addition: <result>
# # print("Subtraction:", a - b)  # Subtraction: <result>
# # print("Multiplication:", a * b)  # Multiplication: <result>
# # print("Division:", a / b)  # Division: <result>
# # print("Floor Division:", a // b)  # Floor Division: <result>
# # print("Modulus:", a % b)  # Modulus: <result>
# # print("Exponentiation:", a**b)  # Exponentiation: <result>
# # # This program performs various arithmetic operations on two user-input numbers
# # # and prints the results.


# # # Relational Operators
# # a = int(input("Enter first number (a) for comparison: "))
# # b = int(input("Enter second number (b) for comparison: "))
# # print(a == b)  # <result>
# # print(a != b)  # <result>
# # print(a > b)  # <result>
# # print(a < b)  # <result>
# # print(a >= b)  # <result>
# # print(a <= b)  # <result>
# # # This program compares two user-input numbers using relational operators
# # # and prints the boolean results.


# # # Assignment Operators
# # a = int(input("Enter a number (a) for assignment operations: "))
# # b = int(input("Enter a number (b) for assignment operations: "))
# # a += b
# # print("a += b:", a)  # a += b: <result>
# # a -= b
# # print("a -= b:", a)  # a -= b: <result>
# # a *= b
# # print("a *= b:", a)  # a *= b: <result>
# # a /= b
# # print("a /= b:", a)  # a /= b: <result>
# # a %= b
# # print("a %= b:", a)  # a %= b: <result>
# # # This program demonstrates the use of assignment operators
# # # by performing operations on a user-input variable and printing the results.


# # # Logical Operators
# # a_input = input("Enter first boolean value (True/False) for a: ")
# # b_input = input("Enter second boolean value (True/False) for b: ")
# # a = True if a_input.lower() == "true" else False
# # b = True if b_input.lower() == "true" else False
# # print("a and b:", a and b)  # a and b: <result>
# # print("a or b:", a or b)  # a or b: <result>
# # print("not a:", not a)  # not a: <result>
# # print("not b:", not b)  # not b: <result>
# # # This program uses logical operators to evaluate boolean expressions
# # # based on user-input boolean values and prints the results.
# # # and prints the results based on user-input boolean values.


# # # Type Casting
# # # # Implicit Type Casting
# # a = int(input("Enter an integer (a): "))  # int
# # b = float(input("Enter a float (b): "))  # float
# # c = a + b  # int + float = float
# # print(
# #     "Implicit Type Casting:", c, type(c)
# # )  # Implicit Type Casting: <result> <class 'float'>
# # # # This program demonstrates implicit type casting
# # # # by adding an integer and a float and printing the result and its type.
# # # # Explicit Type Casting
# x = input("Enter a number (x) to be converted to int: ")  # str
# y = int(x)  # str to int
# z = float(x)  # str to float
# print(
#     "Explicit Type Casting to int:", y, type(y)
# )  # Explicit Type Casting to int: <result> <class 'int'>
# print(
#     "Explicit Type Casting to float:", z, type(z)
# )  # Explicit Type Casting to float: <result> <class 'float'>
# # # This program demonstrates explicit type casting
# # by converting a user-input string to int and float
# # and printing the results and their types.
# # # and prints the results and their types.
# # # This program demonstrates both implicit and explicit type casting
# # # and prints the results along with their types.
# # # This program demonstrates explicit type casting
# # # by converting a user-input string to int and float
# # # and printing the results and their types.


# # Let's Practice
# # WAP to input side of a square & print its area.
# side = float(input("Enter the side of the square: "))
# area = side * side
# print("Area of the square is:", area)


# # Let's Practice
# # WAP to input 2 floating point numbers & print their average.
# num1 = float(input("Enter first floating point number: "))
# num2 = float(input("Enter second floating point number: "))
# average = (num1 + num2) / 2
# print("Average of the two numbers is:", average)

# # Let's Practice
# # WAP to input 2 int numbers, a and b.
# # Print True if a is greater than or equal to b. If not print False.
# a = int(input("Enter first integer (a): "))
# b = int(input("Enter second integer (b): "))
# print(a >= b)  # True if a is greater than or equal to b, else false
